            <h2>Responses</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Interviewees appropriately put the belt around their waists, but were not sure how to put it on afterwards</li>
                <li>They said it would be very difficult to tell someone how to out the belt on without showing them directly</li>
                <li>They also did not think they could figure out how to use the belt without someone else helping them</li>
                <li>Interviewees liked how slim and comfortable the belt was, but did not appreciate the lack of directions</li>
                <li>To improve the design, they suggested adding visual instructions and having the different parts be different colors</li>
